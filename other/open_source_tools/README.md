Questions to [David Rotermund](mailto:davrot@uni-bremen.de)


## Why is my hard disk / SSD so full?
[WinDirStat](https://windirstat.net/) and [QDirStat](https://github.com/shundhammer/qdirstat) will help you answering this question.

## Digitale Lehre

[OBS](https://obsproject.com/) : Open Broadcaster Software is a tool for video streaming (e.g. recording and switching between sources)

[VoiceMeeter](https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/) : Not "free" (shows ads) but important companion tool for OBS to mange audio streams

[FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) : command line tools for manipulation (inclusive conversion of formats) nearly every aspect of MPEG video files

## [Octave](https://octave.org/index.html) (replacement for Matlab)

## LaTex

[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) : "The easy to use, online, collaborative LaTeX editor". You can get the premium version (very important if you want to track the changes) for free via IEEE. 
* 1. Create an overleaf account 
* 2. [Register for free](https://ieee-collabratec.ieee.org/)

[TeX Live Collection](https://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-iso.html) : It is a collection of tools essential for compiling tex files. I suggest to use the DVD for installation otherwise you will grow very old before installation ends.

[TeXnicCenter](https://www.texniccenter.org/) (Windows) : Latex Editor (that prefers [MikTex](https://miktex.org/download) instead of Tex Live)

[Kile](https://kile.sourceforge.io/) (Linux): Latex Editor which is provided by many Linux distributions

[Ghostscript](https://ghostscript.com/releases/gsdnld.html) : (Not Open Source but... ) PostScript interpreter

## Editors (for source code and such)

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) : Well this is not the open source version but there is one which is called [vscodium](https://vscodium.com/). 

[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) (Fully Open Source ; Hardcore to learn but religiously defended by its users )

[http://midnight-commander.org/](https://midnight-commander.org/) : (Fully Open Source) More then JUST a simple editor!

## SSH

[FileZilla **Client**](https://filezilla-project.org/) : Not really Open Source but essential tool for transferring files via SSH. One of the few tools that can resume a failed transaction.

[MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) (Windows) : (not Open Source but kind of "free") SSH Client with X included
