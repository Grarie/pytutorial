## The goal
Obviously, you can write your code as YOU want.

However, if there is at least a small probability that you will exchange your code with someone (e.g. me!) or the source code is required to accompany a paper then…

**... you should NOT ignore PEP 8.**

A good source code editor (like Visual Studio Code) will try to enforce many of the PEP 8 rules on you automatically. You need to allow it to help you… Don’t work against it! This is one of the main reasons why to use such an complex editor!

**Or in short: You don't need to know these rules (i don't know them too) if your editor does it for you!!!**
