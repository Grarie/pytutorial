# S1 Advanced programming and data analysis

In this specialization course, you will work on two projects, one on simulation, and one on data analysis. The projects include **mandatory tasks**, which you have to solve in order to obtain the two study achievements:

* **Study achievement #1:** Write and hand in your commented Python code for the two projects. We will assess if your code runs correctly and produces meaningful results.
* **Study achievement #2:** We will randomly select one of the two projects, and you have to explain us your code for this project, and be able to answer our questions to aspects of your solution ($\sim$30 mins.).

The study achievements will not be graded, they just have to be accomplished successfully for getting the credits for this course. We encourage students to work together in groups of two, but require each student to write her/his own, independent code! If we get two solutions from a group which are too similar, this group will have failed study achievement \#1.

In an extra document, we will put all model definitions, equations, and further (mathematical) details and resources you might need.

We are aware that we have a group with a great variety in prior experience and exposure to programming tasks. Therefore we also included **voluntary tasks**, which give you the opportunity to explore more complex, challenging, and probably also more interesting aspects in simulation and data analysis.
