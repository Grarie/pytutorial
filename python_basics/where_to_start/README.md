Questions to [David Rotermund](mailto:davrot@uni-bremen.de)


## [Python​](https://www.python.org/) 

> Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively.

* There is an offical [Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)
* YouTube: Socratica Channel [Python Programming Tutorials​](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY6m6_IIN94&list=PLi01XoE8jYohWFPpC17Z-wWhPOSuh8Er-)

## [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

You need an editor for writing Python code. We suggest to use [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as an editor. It supports many operations systems.

> Code editing. Redefined. Free. Built on open source. Runs everywhere.

## [Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html)

[What is NumPy?​](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/whatisnumpy.html)

> NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.
